## Assignment report

👉 Did you forget to replace this text?

### Reflection

<!-- 
    Your thoughts on the assignment. What was hard, what have you learned? What could you have done differently? 

-->

I could've not underestimate the assignment, I thought this was going to be something an AI can do in ten minutes so I waited a while before getting started but there's a lot of stuff that makes it hard, the worst part was ESlint but I got some files and commands that format it properly.
I didn't use a book when making this, I think it's an outdated and time-wasting method, I used ChatGPT for parts of the program and gave it clarification when something was wrong or I fixed it myself.
I'll list the things I learned, ChatGPT taught me most of it.
1. The # prefix turns one thing into a private thing and it can only be used inside that class
2. If you put ... before the name of an array you get all the elements inside it, visually it removes the [] parts so if you don't use ... you get [[array]]
It's mostly used for creating a new array.
3. I also got help with the ESlint stuff
You could call it OCD for programmers but I learned that after a description there needs to be a line with only * and no spaces afterwards
4. There's more I learned about it, syntax goes like @param {Player} player - The player participating., the type in an object and then the variable name and then the description and if a function returns nothing you add @return void
I wouldn't say AI created this code because that's basically saying it created everything, there's code that was finished from the start and I've also adjusted it a lot to make it work with the diagram, rule fixes, natural win conditions etc.


### Further improvements

<!-- 
    Further improvements of the assignment. What could you have done but did not have the time to complete? 
-->

I wouldn't hand it in if something is missing
The optional tasks for a harder challenge, I didn't do those

### Extras

<!--
    Have you done anything more than the requirements? Preferably, add each additional requirement as an issue and reference it here using # followed by the issue id.
-->

### Feedback

<!-- 
    Feedback to the course management about the assignment.
-->

Maybe something that is advanced. This was kind of hard but not advanced, knowing how to code something advanced puts you ahead of others because AI can't replace that part yet. For easy things, AI can finish it in a minute, for medium things, takes a while and clarification, but advanced logic, AI is going to be completely lost.
If we could choose our assignments that would be great too.
List ChatGPT on https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurser/webbprogrammering-pa-klientsidan/studieguide/larresurser
ChatGPT is an amazing learning tool, assuming the user takes time to learn what the code does. It can be a lot of unfamiliar code but they'll learn it little by little.
